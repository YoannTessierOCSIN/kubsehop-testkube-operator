# Kubtest operator 

This is the k8s operator for [Kubtest](https://github.com/kubeshop/kubtest/) - your friendly Kubernetes testing framework!

*`Please note!`* For now it has limited functionality and only installs needed CRDs (custom resurces definitions) into an active k8s cluster. 
It's meant to be installed as a part of main Helm chart as described in the [Installation](https://kubeshop.github.io/kubtest/installing/) guide.
